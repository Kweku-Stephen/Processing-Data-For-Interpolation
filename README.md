This project involves Computing the deviation of Obsserved Climate Data(1980-2016) from the RCP2.6 and 8.5(2020-2050) projected Data for the meteorological Stations: Wa, Tamale, Bole, Navrongo and Yendi in Ghana. It looks at how both scenarios (RCP 2.6 and 8.5) diverge in the future. 
Datasets involved do not reside in the same workind directory and therefore some scripts have their working directories stated atop of them even though all scripts are connected to each other.
