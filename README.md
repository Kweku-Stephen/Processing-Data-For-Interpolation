This project involves Computing the deviation of Obsserved Climate Data from the RCP26 and 85 projected Data for the meteorological Stations: Wa, Tamale, Bole, Navrongo and Yendi in Ghana. It looks at how both scenarios (RCP 26 and 85) diverge in the future. 
Datasets involved do not reside in the same workind directory and therefore some scripts have their working directories stated atop of them.
